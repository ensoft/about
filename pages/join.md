## What we look for

Our team recruits recent graduates, typically straight from University.

Unusually, a formal background in Computer Science is **not** a must-have requirement.

 - If you do have a formal education and/or lots of coding experience, then you absolutely have a big head start! You'll start learning straight away how to apply those skills to mission-critical Internet-scale problems that help millions of people.

 - But equally, if you came to coding late in your degree and don't have much experience, then if you have the right aptitude and enthusiasm, we can train you.

We have lots of successful employees in both categories.

What we do require is smart people - it's very challenging to create simple, robust solutions to very complex problems - who work well as part of a high-performing team.

Also unusually, we don't "parachute in" senior management or architectural hires from outside - all senior roles have been organically filled from within. That means we have a critical business need to employ individuals who are inquisitive, always want to learn, eager for real responsibility, and with a diverse set of strengths and skills. It also means our training and career development have to be first-class, enabling us to prioritise potential over experience.

## Training

![Training](/pages/img/syllabus.png)

We never stop learning new skills and technologies. But the formal, company-led part of the new graduate training roughly falls into three phases:

 - "EnDuction": for the first few weeks, all the new starters work through an intensive programme together. This covers a baseline of not just technical skills and knowledge, but also orientation for the company and team, and social introductions. People get a lot of free lunches out, to meet everyone!

 - After that, the new graduates are dispersed into their teams (typically 3-6 people) where their training continues in the context of a real mission-critical project. The best way to learn is by doing, but there's a lot of help in this phase, including a dedicated mentor and extra classes.

 - By the end of the first year, most people are capable developers in at least one niche, but there is a huge amount to learn. So the balance shifts to a more advanced multi-year baseline syllabus, that gradually blends into a more tailored development path for that individual.

People get more responsibility as soon as they want it and show they are able (which can be very soon, for those with more experience) - we won't slow you down! But you will never be left stranded either - there is always all the support and help you need.

As with the other aspects of [culture](/pages/culture.md), everyone gets their own individual consideration. There are so many activities that need doing - ranging from pure software development to project management, from finding the trickiest bugs to writing great tests, from looking after people to interacting with customers - that everyone has their own balance of strengths and preferences. We help people pave the career path that they want.

## Benefits

A whistle-stop summary of benefits includes:

 - Competitive starting salary

There are a few more listed on [this page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/careers/we-are-cisco/benefits-and-perks.html).

## Inside View

The best people to tell you what it's like to start working here are our recent graduate recruits - so we asked a few of them about their career journey so far.

You can see what they had to say [here](https://blogs.cisco.com/wearecisco/joining-ciscos-ensoft-team)!

## Internships

Interning with the Ensoft team comes in two flavours: summer internships and micro-internships. Your ideal choice depends on whether you'd like a taster or a full-length project, and your prior coding experience.

### Summer Internships

Our full-length paid internships run through the summer for at least 8 weeks. This gives you the chance to truly experience life as a professional software engineer, using the same methodology and practices that we employ day-to-day - and you'll also have the chance to join in with any socials happening during your stay!

Since the timescale is relatively short, we do require enough coding experience to make a meaningful contribution in a few weeks. Intern projects are typically self-contained, so you have the opportunity to shape something new. It's not uncommon for intern projects to end up used in production.

### Micro Internships

We sometimes also run paid micro-internships, that last just one week.

When they are on offer, they are advertised separately. They provide a taster of what it is like at Cisco Ensoft, and the opportunity to write some software professionally, albeit on a small project. We require enough coding experience to make a meaningful contribution in the week.

## Apply

The application process is as easy as we can make it:

 1. Submit a CV via the [Cisco hiring page](https://cisco.yello.co/app/collect/event/mxK2CUqfaJqiB-AEMRfRTg) for the role you want (full-time graduate or summer intern).
 2. If you're selected for interview, there will be two interview chats, and one short test (currently all administered online).
 3. That's it.

Information we need to see on your CV includes:

1. **Contact details**: name, home and term addresses, telephone number, personal email, and web page (if appropriate).
2. **Pre-University Education**: secondary schools attended, type of schools, dates of attendance, GCSEs (subjects and grades) and A-levels (subjects and grades).
3. **University Education**: Universities attended, dates of attendance, courses taken, subjects studied each year, and any scholarships/awards/prizes.
4. **Experience**: summary of computing experience, work experience, interests and vacation activities.
5. **Additional Info**: visa requirements, anything which helps us get to know you better.

No referees are required at this stage; we will only request these details from successful candidates.

If you have any questions, and have a GitHub account, feel free to [open an issue here](https://github.com/ensoft/about/issues/new/choose) if you want to talk to a human being. Good luck!

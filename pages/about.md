# About Cisco Ensoft

## Introduction

Cisco Ensoft is a team of around 80 software engineers working for Cisco, the
world's largest computer networking company. The Ensoft team deliver software
solutions for the most critical and high-capacity routers that run the
Internet.

Development is based on the team's renowned [development
methodology](/pages/culture.md#quality). This approach embraces the innovation
of our engineers and provides a framework of collaboration within the team, yet
affords management control to ensure high quality and that we meet our delivery
dates.

## History

Ensoft was originally a startup, and quickly formed a relationship whereby Cisco
gained exclusive access to the technology created by the Ensoft team, as part of
Cisco's next-generation operating system. The Cisco products using this
technology have been very widely deployed, and form a large fraction of the
Internet backbone.

In 2019, this very close relationship was formalised, with Ensoft being acquired
by Cisco. This enabled the Ensoft team to continue focussing on creating
advanced software, with the full supporting resources of a successful global
corporation.

## Approach

As both an independent company, and more recently as part of Cisco, many things
about the Ensoft team have remained consistent:

 - A mission to write complex software that matters to the world.
 - Taking pride in creating customer satisfaction and business success.
 - Growing the team by selecting a few top graduates each year and investing
   heavily in their training and development. Even the most senior leaders in
   the team arrived as graduates and evolved into these roles.
 - Creating a [unique culture](/pages/culture.md) that combines supportive
   collaboration, and world-class excellence. We enjoy each others' company as
   well as the work.

## Awards

As a small company, Ensoft climbed the charts of the Sunday Times "100 Best
Companies to Work For" list, ending up as the [top small software company in the
UK, and #3
across all sectors](https://www.b.co.uk/the-lists/small-companies/?year-2018-p-266-749/)
in its final year as an independent company.

Since acquisition, Cisco has, for example, come [#1 in the global "World's Best Workplace" awards two years
running](https://blogs.cisco.com/wearecisco/cisco-worlds-best-workplace), and
was ranked #2 across UK super-large
employers in
[2020](https://www.greatplacetowork.co.uk/awards/uks-best-workplaces/uks-best-workplaces-2020/)
and [2022](https://www.greatplacetowork.co.uk/awards/uks-best-workplaces/uks-best-workplaces-2022/).

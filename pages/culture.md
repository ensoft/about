## Career Development

At Cisco Ensoft, we make a big bet: we hire graduates based on potential, and
trust that over time they will want to stay, learn, develop, and grow into all
the senior roles the team needs.

Everyone is initially hired as a software engineer. First and foremost, you're
expected to become a first-rate professional developer. (If your interests are
more adjancent to that, such as technical sales, then there are [other roles
within Cisco](https://jobs.cisco.com) that you'll probably enjoy more.)

Many people remain in a pure software development role, and that's great! But
over time, some people also want to take on other forms of responsibility:

The team is small enough that everyone has an individual career path tailored
around their strengths, ambitions, and desires. There aren't rigid "tracks" that
you have to conform to.

Different people want to take on different combinations of responsibility for
technical decisions, projects, and people. You can try different things, see
what you like, and evolve a role that is just right for you.

## Quality

![banner](/pages/img/enquality.png)

Our software development standards combine the formal demands of ISO 9000 with
the hands-on management style of the Ensoft team. This allows developers to take
ownership of their work with creativity and craft, but benefit from the review
and support of the team they work with.

Cisco Ensoft projects almost always come in on time, with very high quality,
with high feature velocity, and without stress.

## Office

![Office](/pages/img/office.jpg)

The office is there to provide a relaxed and supportive environment, so
you are free to focus on doing great work - whether that's concentrating on
writing some code on your own, or collaborating with colleagues.

There's no dress code - everyone is encouraged to dress in a way that is
comfortable and reflects their personality.

Obviously right now, things are different due to COVID, and our collaborative
environment has [successfully moved online](/pages/covid.md). But normally:

 - Everyone gets a sit-stand desk, high-spec laptop, ergonomic Herman Miller
   desk chair etc.
 - The environment is totally open plan - even for the most senior people - but
   there are lots of meeting rooms, since we talk a lot! There are also quiet
   areas if you want to really concentrate on something.

As with any creative problem solving, sometimes you need a change of scene to
relax, or let the ideas flow. So there's not only a bunch of tea rooms (good for
gossip as well as beverages), a well-fitted kitchen, and a lounge area (with
settees); there's also a wide variety of office games (currently table tennis,
pool, table football and darts), complete with a home-made bot to keep track of
scores and overall rankings.

People do all sorts of things together at lunch time, ranging from the very
sweaty (running, cycling, swimming, gym) to the more cerebral (board games or
crosswords)

We also have a team breakfast together each week, and a choice of biscuits,
fruit, and healthy snacks.

## Location

Our office location is the best of both worlds: set in the heart of the
Hertfordshire countryside, yet a stone's throw from a station with a very fast
connection into London.

![Harpenden location](/pages/img/harpenden-location.jpg)

You can choose your lifestyle from many options, eg:

 - Harpenden is an attractive small town, where you can walk to the office and
   hang out after work. Thanks to its excellent commute, it has a thriving centre
   with shops, pubs and restaurants.
 - London is a short train ride away - just 25 minutes to Kings Cross.
 - The City of St Albans is just 5 minutes away by train, bringing a wider
   social scene (theatres, clubs, a wider selection of bars) and all the
   facilities offered by a modern city.
 - There are smaller, quieter villages with an easy commute, by car or bike, to
   our offices.
 - A few employees live further afield, such as Cambridge.

## Socials

![Socials](/pages/img/social.jpg)

Ask pretty much any person in Cisco Ensoft, and they'll say the other people there are not just trusted work colleagues, but genuine friends. The social scene is a vital part of the team culture.

This has multiple facets. At one end of the spectrum are official, company-funded events. These range from London comedy to Snowdonia walks, from Christmas parties (including partners) to family-friendly summer parties (complete with bouncy castles for all ages).

At the other end, lots of people just arrange to have fun together in a vast number of different ways. These range from quick pub trips to the annual ski trip, Friday lunch out to going to the gym or swimming pool together, from fantasy football to fantasy Bake-Off.

In between are many activities that the company might support in some way. For example, football or cricket matches (complete with barbeque for those who prefer to just watch), sometimes against other local tech companies, team relay triathlons, or charity road races.

## Giving Back

We believe we are here to make a difference, not just make money.

All employees are given the chance to take five days to volunteer for a cause of their choice every year through the [Time2Give](https://blogs.cisco.com/tag/time2give) scheme. (It was extended to ten days for 2020, due to the exceptional situation of COVID-19.) There's corporate donation matching of up to $10,000 per annum. Any time someone volunteers for an hour, they can claim a $10 donation from Cisco for the charity.

For more information about Cisco's commitment to corporate social responsibility (or 'CSR'), check out [Cisco's CSR page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/csr.html) or even the [Cisco CSR Twitter](https://twitter.com/ciscocsr?lang=en)!

## Diversity

We are committed to a diverse workforce. As with almost all tech companies, we have work to do still, but we are serious at all
levels about the commitment. For example Cisco ranked #2 in Fortune's [100 Best Workplaces for Diversity](https://blogs.cisco.com/diversity/diversity-award) list for 2019.

One article on diversity within Cisco can be found [here](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/inclusion-diversity/us.html); this includes a snapshot of the current diversity levels, and lots of other information such as pay parity and company initiatives to develop an equal, fair and inclusive workplace for all.

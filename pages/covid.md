# COVID-19

## Working

As with most tech companies, we have been working fully remotely since before
the official government lockdown.

Our work is highly collaborative and social, but we've found a rhythm of working
together using remote tools that works well for us. There is support for
ensuring everyone's "home office" setup meets all their technical and ergonomic
needs.

We've even found success with our new team members, who have "arrived" into a
purely virtual environment without any relationships established face-to-face
beforehand! Our new starter training, for the new full-time  graduates arriving
in autumn 2020, has been going really well. And one of our summer interns said
this:

> It was a really great experience! This year it was a lot tougher to organize
> since I was working remotely from home, but even through all that they managed
> to make me feel like I was in the office cooperating with everyone. Whenever I
> had a question or needed to consult something, there was always someone
> available to help me out, so the whole atmosphere felt very supportive and
> productive. It was very rewarding working with a dedicated team of developers
> on a project that ultimately helps many Cisco developers improve their
> workflow.

This is despite working entirely from home, with just a laptop arriving in the
post.

## Application process

Our application process also easily translates to a fully online experience.
Just [submit a CV](https://jobs.cisco.com/jobs/SearchJobs/Ensoft). If you're
selected for interview, you'll just get a short online test, and two video
interviews (maybe 30 minutes each).

It's all as simple, friendly, and low-stress as we can make it! See [what some
people](https://blogs.cisco.com/wearecisco/joining-ciscos-ensoft-team) thought
of the process before it went fully online.

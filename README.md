# Welcome to Cisco Ensoft!

Cisco Ensoft is a UK team of engineers, developing software technology that runs the
Internet.

You might have seen a flyer for our [graduate careers or
internships](https://cs.co/ensoft), or a [job
advert](https://careers.cisco.com/global/en/job/2000025/Ensoft-Early-in-Career-Software-Engineer).

But maybe you were still a bit curious for more back-story? If so, then this repo is for you!

## "Run the Internet"?

The Internet underpins everything we do.
It's how we learn, play, work, relax, connect, even fall in love.

But the Internet doesn't build itself, and it has to evolve rapidly.

Our team creates the critical software that is deployed by the global networks
that make up the Internet. It's complex, it matters, and it's what we enjoy.

And we've grown the team by recruiting just a few of the best graduates each
year, investing heavily in their training and development.
